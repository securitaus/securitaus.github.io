Everything you do through products such as Gmail, YouTube, Google search, and many other 
products, Google collects data and builds a personal profile on things you like, do, or think. 
This data is collected to send targeted ads to you based on your profile.

Google has released a new [My Activity][google-activity] tool, that shows a detailed timeline 
of all the stuff that is known about you from your activity and is categorized by topic or 
interest.

To review your activity through Google, visit [myaccount.google.com][google-myaccount], click 
on "Manage your Google Activity", then click "GO TO MY ACTIVITY."

Google gives you several options to delete this information. Click on the three dots located 
in the upper right-hand corner of the menu bar. From the drop-down menu select "Delete 
activity by." Change "Today" to "All time" to delete all your activity.

Google has also given users the ability to control the activity that is collected. To control 
your activity settings, visit [myaccount.google.com][google-myaccount], click on "Manage your 
Google Activity", then click "GO TO ACTIVITY CONTROLS."

Within the "Activity controls" page you can toggle on or pause the various activities that are 
collected.
